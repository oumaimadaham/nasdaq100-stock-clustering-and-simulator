# NASDAQ-100 Stock Clustering & Investment Simulator

## Why This Project?

Investors face the challenge of navigating a large number of stocks without clear guidance on which are safe, risky, or high growth. **The NASDAQ-100** contains some of the most important technology and growth companies in the world, but their behavior varies greatly.

This project aims to:

- Analyze **NASDAQ-100 stock** data (2022â€“2024)
- Measure returns, risk, and volatility
- Group stocks into clusters so investors can easily compare risk/return profiles
- Provide an interactive investment simulator so anyone can test how their money might perform

This project helps transform raw financial data into **actionable insights for decision-making**.
